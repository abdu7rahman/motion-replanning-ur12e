# reactive_replanning_ur12e

Reactive motion replanning for a UR12e + Robotiq Hand-E using a RealSense D435i for live obstacle detection. Built on ROS 2 Jazzy and MoveIt 2.

The arm runs a pick-and-place demo and routes around obstacles seen by the depth camera in real time. If a hand or other object enters the planned path mid-motion, the controller cancels cleanly, waits for the arm to settle, and re-plans from the current state.

## Detection pipeline

Each cloud frame from `/camera/camera/depth/color/points` is filtered in this order:

1. **Depth filter** in camera frame (`DEPTH_MIN`–`DEPTH_MAX` meters)
2. **Batch TF transform** to `base_link` using a single rotation matrix multiply
3. **Workspace bounding box** in `base_link` — drops floor, walls, robot pedestal, anything outside the working volume
4. **Color filter** — drops UR12e's palette (light gray / off-white housing, black accents, light-blue/teal trim) with a Kovac-rule skin protection so hands never get filtered
5. **Multi-link robot self-filter** — line-segment distance to every link shaft + joint-origin spheres + tool0 gripper guard, all dilated across the last 3 frames of arm motion (kills phantoms from points that get unmasked when the arm moves past)

Whatever survives is foreign. Centroid → published as a `CollisionObject` sphere on `/apply_planning_scene` so MoveIt can plan around it.

## Replanning strategy

Primary: `MoveGroup` action with pose constraints + `replan=True`, using **BITstar** (asymptotically optimal OMPL planner) with a 2.5 s budget for smooth, near-optimal paths.

During execution a monitor runs at 10 Hz:
- Reads `tool0` from TF (no FK service call)
- If the obstacle has *moved* since plan time AND any upcoming waypoint is within `SPHERE_RADIUS + PATH_CLEARANCE` of it, preempts the goal
- Cancels cleanly, polls joint velocities until the arm is at rest, then recursively replans from the new state (capped at depth 2)

Fallback chain when the primary plan can't be found:
1. `MoveGroup` retry after clearing the sphere (handles `START_STATE_IN_COLLISION`)
2. **IK redundancy**: ~120 IK solutions, sorted by joint distance from current state, plan up to 8 candidates and execute the shortest under the trajectory-length cap. Uses RRTConnect for speed.
3. Arc detour (cartesian over the obstacle) as last resort

## Visualization

The launch file points RViz at `config/reactive_replanning.rviz`, which loads on startup with:

- **RobotModel** — live joint state
- **PointCloud2** — `/camera/camera/depth/color/points` (Best Effort QoS so it actually displays)
- **PlannedEEFPath** — `nav_msgs/Path` republish of MoveIt's `/display_planned_path`, drawn as a green line tracing the tool0 path
- **Trajectory** — animated robot ghost following the planned trajectory with a trail
- **MotionPlanning** — full MoveIt panel for manual planning

The path republisher subscribes to `/display_planned_path`, FKs each subsampled waypoint to get tool0, and publishes on `/planned_eef_path`. Skipped during IK redundancy to avoid choking the FK service queue.

## Running

Three terminals.

**T1 — full stack:**
```bash
ros2 launch reactive_replanning_ur12e reactive_replanning_full.launch.py
```

**T2 — RealSense camera with point cloud:**
```bash
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py pointcloud.enable:=true
```

**T3 — the demo:**
```bash
ros2 run reactive_replanning_ur12e reactive_replanning
```

When prompted, press ENTER to start the cycles. Move your hand into the workspace at any time to trigger detection and a replan.

## Tuning

Everything is a ROS parameter. `config/tuning.yaml` carries the defaults and is
loaded by the launch file; the node runs identically without it, because the
class attributes it mirrors are the same values.

```bash
ros2 launch reactive_replanning_ur12e reactive_replanning.launch.py \
  params_file:=/path/to/my_cell.yaml

# or override one thing without a file
ros2 run reactive_replanning_ur12e reactive_replanning \
  --ros-args -p preempt_dist:=0.28 -p ws_z_min:=0.05
```

The pick and place poses are not coordinates. `compute_home_fk()` asks MoveIt
for the EEF pose at `HOME_JOINTS` and `_build_poses()` offsets it, so they
follow the robot rather than assuming where it is bolted down.

| Group | Parameters | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| Task | `pick_z_offset`, `place_y_offset` | Where the pick and place sit relative to the home EEF pose |
| Planning | `ik_attempts`, `ik_pool_size`, `max_traj_length`, `short_path_eps`, `vel_scale`, `acc_scale` | Size of the IK redundancy search and how aggressively it settles for a short path |
| Camera | `depth_min`, `depth_max`, `cloud_throttle` | Depth gate in the optical frame, and how often frames are processed |
| Workspace | `ws_x_min/max`, `ws_y_min/max`, `ws_z_min/max` | The box in `base_link` that counts. **Re-measure these when the cell moves** — outside it is the pedestal, the floor and whoever is standing behind the robot |
| Self-filter | `use_color_filter`, `color_gray_sum`, `color_gray_diff`, `color_black_sum`, `arm_seg_radius`, `arm_joint_radius`, `eef_guard_radius`, `arm_link_pairs` | Telling the robot apart from everything else. The colour numbers are for this arm's housing under this lighting |
| Detection | `obstacle_threshold`, `debounce_frames`, `obstacle_ttl`, `obstacle_move_eps`, `sphere_radius` | How many surviving points count as an obstacle, and how long it persists |
| Reaction | `preempt_dist`, `warn_dist`, `path_clearance`, `decel_wait`, `max_replan_depth`, `detour_height` | When a motion is cancelled mid-execution and what happens next |

The self-filter geometry is still a hand-written capsule model rather than
something read out of the URDF — `arm_link_pairs` makes the chain configurable,
but the radii are two numbers for an arm whose links are not all the same
thickness. That is the next thing worth fixing here.

## Notes

- The `ur12e_hande_bringup` package is treated as read-only — none of its files are touched. All custom config lives in this package.
- OctoMap's `occupancy_map_monitor` plugin doesn't load on this MoveIt 2 Jazzy build. Direct point-cloud → `CollisionObject` injection is used instead, which gives MoveIt's planning scene the same information without depending on the broken plugin.
- Velocity scaling is intentionally conservative. The UR controller's max deceleration is what actually triggers protective stops on cancel — ramping deceleration limits in the URDF/controllers config is the way to soften that further.
